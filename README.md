# MIPS_floating_point_multiplication_NOFPU
 This Assembly program will multiply two numbers using only integer operation for a device without a floating point unit.

 Additonally, the program will effiecently take two floating point inputs, multiply them using only integer instructions in the MIPS architecture. Moreover, this will use the Rounding To Nearest Even method. Also, the program will follow the IEEE754 representation. where it can deal with all possible cases (normalized, denormalized, zero, infinity, NaN) with the single precision encoding.
 Please use the Mars tool.
